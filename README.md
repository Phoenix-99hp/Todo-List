# Todo-List

Deployed: https://phoenix-99hp.github.io/Todo-List/

This is a todo list that I made while following the Odin Project's Curriculum. It was made using webpack and different modules were exported between files. 

This todo list allows the user to enter in a title, description, date, and priority level for each todo entry. RegEx validation techniques are used to notify the user of any invalid inputs. Once the todo is successfully entered it is displayed on the page as demonstrated in the attached screenshot. If the priority level selected is low then the date will appear green, if it is medium the date will appear yellow, and if it is high the date will appear red. Clicking the plus icon will show the user the description of the todo and clicking the minus icon will hide the description. The other two icons to the right of the todo are edit and delete respectively.
